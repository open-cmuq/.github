# Welcome to the CMUQ Open Source Organization
The open-cmuq project is a faculty &amp; student driven initiative to empower students to contribute to open source software, developed in-house for the CMU-Qatar community. This is where you will find new projects we are building in summers, and old projects we are maintaining / looking for maintainers to champion and own.

## üéØ Our Mission

- **Promote Open-Source Culture**: Foster a community where open-source collaboration thrives at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar.
- **Sustain Student Projects**: Ensure that student-created software remains accessible and maintainable for future generations.
- **Engage Students**: Provide opportunities for students to work on meaningful projects during their free time, especially in the summer.
